# PIT ‚Äì A Lightweight Git Replica

**PIT** is a simplified, educational version-control tool inspired by Git. Built for learning and experimentation, it mimics Git's core features while offering a lightweight and developer-friendly experience.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è PIT is not a replacement for Git. It is intended for learning and skill development.

## üöÄ Features

- Basic version control operations (init, add, commit, etc.)
- PIT-specific aliases for selected commands (e.g., `init` ‚Üí `start`, `merge` ‚Üí `mix`)
- Command-line interface mimicking Git structure
- Planned support for `.gitignore` (manual entry only; no autocomplete)
